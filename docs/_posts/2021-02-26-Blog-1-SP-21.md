Terraform by HashiCorp, a member of the AWS DevOps Competency and an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner, is a “infrastructure as code” tool similar to AWS CloudFormation that allows you to build, upgrade, and version your Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
Breaking down the setup into smaller chunks allows for better structure, reusability, and maintainability. This function is discussed in greater depth in the article's final section.


While you can have an AWS access key directly to Terraform via the provider, we suggest that you use a credential profile already installed by one of the AWS Software Developer Kits (SDKs). This prevents you from trying to keep secrets in several places or committing them to version control by mistake. In any case, make sure to read through our best practices for keeping healthy security habits. Alternatively, you can use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile to run Terraform from one or more control servers.


Terraform configuration files are stored into modules. Components are designed to be shared and reused across projects, but they can also be used within a project to help structure a complex service with multiple infrastructure components. Terraform only operates for files who end in the filename. Subdirectories are reserved for modules in the current operating folder.

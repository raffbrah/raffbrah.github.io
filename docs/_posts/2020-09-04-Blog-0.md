Docker is a type of virtual software that allows a user to run programs as applications on a host machine. Docker allows you to have images and containers. Docker containers run like a service of the host machine and is transparent to the host OS. There are type of commands that you can use to test if docker is installed. 
-docker info
-docker --version

You can also pull different types of images but for me i used ubuntu so i used this command
-docker pull ubuntu

To see if your image is pulled correctly you can use this command
docker image ls -a

To initialize and run the container you would have to use this command
docker run -it ubuntu 

After that there should be a container with ubuntu and you can use the linux filesystem and commands within it.  

Docker is a lightweight service that allows for easier implementation and usage of containers rather than running a virtual machine and doing it from there.

This week I started my final project with my group in COMP 484. We had to design our own website using specific libraries or frameworks, the one that my group decided to incorporate was REACCTjs. We had to create properties which returned a hiearchy of views to displya through the render method. Our theme for our website is to showcase all of donald trump and joe biden tweets and show the difference of the campaign amongst both of our presidential candidates. The render method will return a description of what we want to see on the screen and in this case the tweets from both Trump and Biden. We are going to create functions like React.createElement. Although we have the basis of the idea for our project, we still have to create a UI and design it so it looks nice.

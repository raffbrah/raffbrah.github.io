This we were introducted to AWS and I got an invitation to an AWS Education license.
This class hosts webinars on cloud based technology and has a broad amount of topics such as how to create an online class or advanced topics in online learning. These classes help to promote remote learning. 
AWS has certain learning modules that deal with cloud computing, virtaual cloud labs, and even has an AWS educational certificate and promotional creddit for us to build on AWS. They offer at home learning opportunities that are based through the AWS Educate Cloud Career Pathways and give us badges and such when we complete online workshops and seminars. This weekend im going to dive deep and give AWS a try.

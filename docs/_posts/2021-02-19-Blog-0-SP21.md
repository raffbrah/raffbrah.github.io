My group and I collaborated this week and have determined our final project and how we will go about it. We will be using Amazon Web services to create a basic Web application that will be able to host data from the center of disease control and be able to update the live statistics and numbers of how many people in California are receiving the vaccine. The center of disease and control will be the main source of data for our web application and I am very excited to be able to display those numbers in a nice Interface using AWS. 
We are still on the planning stage but we will be using AWS Amplify, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. We have uncovered multiple tutorials and guides to go about this but we want to strictly focus on the purpose of this project.

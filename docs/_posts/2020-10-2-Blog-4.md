For my web engineering class, we had to create our own website using html and styling it with css. I decided to write about another class because this kind of correlates to what we are doing for our blog posts buit instead we are using markdown. 
Initially, the assignment was fairly difficult because I did not know where to start but when I started creating the head, title, body, the rest started to fall in to place. I searched up the color codes for html and such and inserted my pictures using html commands and this gave me an insight in the work that it takes to get a website up and running. 
I realized how all of the CIT courses all fall in to place and each class that i take supports one another. Things i learn in other classes closely correlate to my other ones and this really opened my eyes. 
Doing these blog posts helps me in the future and also in my current job where we have to do plenty of documentation. At work we use ebsuite and use a ticket form of help for IT support requests and these blog posts will help solidify those traits for me.

This week we had to create a dockerfile and run it so we can be able to automate the creation of containers. This lab pretty much automated lab 1 and it was very interesting to do. Looking at the grand scope of things, if we had to create plenty of docker containers this would be the way to go. The lab started with us creating a dockerfile and we put the commands that we needed to use for lab 1 in there. We used the correct syntax and put the linux commands there and although it was very frustrating at first it was a good experience for me as a CIT professional.

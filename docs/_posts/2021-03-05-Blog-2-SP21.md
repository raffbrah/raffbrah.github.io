The ability to schedule tasks on a cron-like schedule or in response to Rest api Events is assisted by Amazon ECS. The both Fargate and EC2 launch styles be needed for Amazon ECS tasks. You may use the Amazon ECS console to build a CloudWatch Events rule that runs one or more activities in the cluster at the scheduled intervals if you have tasks to run at set intervals in your cluster, such as a backup process or a log search.


You can also use CloudWatch Events to set your Fargate tasks as a task goal, allowing you to initiate tasks in response to changes. You can also use the CloudWatch Events console and AWS CLI to switch the communication protocol using the awsvpc access to technology, giving Fargate tasks activated by CloudWatch Events the same networking properties as Amazon EC2 instances.

To edit a scheduled task
Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.

Choose the cluster in which to edit your scheduled task.

On the Cluster: cluster-name page, choose Scheduled Tasks.

Select the box to the left of the schedule rule to edit, and choose Edit.

Edit the fields to update and choose Update.

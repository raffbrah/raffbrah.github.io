This week I was a little more focused on my Information System class than my other classes. We had to go over different erp systems in this class but the primary ones were business central, SYSPRO, and netsuite oracle. This class is a little more different than my other ones because although in a sense it is still in the IT realm of things, it was more focused on the business side of IT. There were different "entities" and "attributes" that had certain roles within each departments, and the ERP systems is what pulls them altogether. We had to setup certain vendors, customers, setup the systems, create different departments and overall, although it was tough, I can see how it can be practical in the future and why IS classes are added to the CIT curriculum.

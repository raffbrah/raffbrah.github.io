This week I dwelled in to editing my Jekyll Website. I changed the homepage title and I also 
tried to look in to the themes. This week in class we talked about docker but I already wrote
about that on my previous blog post. 

I can truly see how convenient github pages can be and how easy it is to update our own webpages
and to update the blogs. Getting familiar with the commands in order to create the file, add it, commit it,
and then push it will truly help me in the future. I encountered some issues when I was trying to push the websites
on the original directory I was working from. I cloned the repository and put it on my desktop and then it fixed
the issues that I was encountering. Although this week we only had one lecture, I am looking forward to the upcoming lab.

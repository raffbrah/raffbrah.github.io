This week the lab made me very engaged to the idea of using docker and its capabilities. Lab 1 being that it was the first lab made me very excited for what is to come

The lab starts with us pulling a Ubuntu image in docker and creating its own containter. As the lab progressed we had to update and upgrade the indexes and the program files so we can get the latest updated programs and packages. We installed Apache, the lab said to install nano but I was more comfortable using vim from my other classes, and a mySQL database.  

We pulled a git repo and cloned it and we were able to do certain modifications for it. A LAMP stack is pretty much a set of open-source (software that can be used to create websites and web appplications. 

LAMP is an acronym for
L: Linux
A: Apache
M: MySql 
P: PHP

At the end of the lab I was able to succesfully set up the LAMP stack and it felt great to view the webpage that I created.
